# Mongo-x-Express-mini_project
This is my Node Express project which helps u perform CRUD operations on a database created using mongoose package
MethodOverride package is also used to perform PUT and DELETE methods in ejs

Here I have used Express,Ejs and MongoDB.

And a little bit of Css was used as well to give a somewhat visually appealing look.
